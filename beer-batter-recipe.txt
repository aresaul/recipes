Basic Beer Batter:

1 egg
1 cup flour
Seasonings to taste (note:  use lots of seasoning!)
1 12-oz beer of your choice

Make sure the beer is as cold as possible without freezing.  
Beat the egg in a bowl until smooth but not bubbly.  In a separate bowl, mix the flour and seasonings.  Add the egg, mix together to form a 'goop'.  Then as much of the beer as it takes for the desired consistency to be reached.  

You can then dredge things in the batter to be fried (cod fillets are a favorite of mine!).
